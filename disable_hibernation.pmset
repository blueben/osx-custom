# Disable system hibernation
#
# System hibernation writes all of the system memory to disk. If the system has a great deal of memory and hibernates
# often this can mean that many gibibytes get written to the disk. In order to save wear on an SSD, this disables
# system hibernation. Be wary: if your laptop does not shut down properly when it runs out of power, bad things happen.
